# NETWORK-TOPOLOGY
NETWORK TOPOLOGY is a C++ (CODEBLOCKS) based project. It finds out the cost required to set up the network in star topology , ring topology, tree topology and shows how the computers will be connected to each other in that particular topology. C++ Graphics have been used to visualise the topology, screenshots of which have been added to the project. It uses graphs and algorithms like Prim's to find minimum spanning tree for Tree topology, Floyd warshall for Star topology, and Hamiltonian to find the Ring topology
